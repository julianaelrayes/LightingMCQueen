Arduino Line Following Robot


Group 7 was successful at designing and producing a line-following robot themed after Lightning McQueen. Using the incorporated Arduino, IR Sensors and Motors, the team managed to come up with a functional line-following prototype, which will be able to provide K-12 students with their first hand-on STEM-related experience. As part of the teamâ€™s commitment to delivering a reliable and durable product, constant tests were done on the robot and its results showed an outstanding performance in all fronts, with the robot being able to thoroughly follow the line at a constant velocity. Although currently, robotic equipment for STEM education is limited and highly-priced, the robot designed by Team 7 provides a perfect alternative which reduces costs, while providing reliability and durability, which will aid in expanding STEM education across teachers and students alike. Our customers will have a very easy time putting together the robot and getting it to run smoothly. The team is eager to begin working on the next-steps to further solidify and implement this prototype as a viable tool for the education of future generations.
